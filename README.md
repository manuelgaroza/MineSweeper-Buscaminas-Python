# MineSweeper-Buscaminas-Python
A Minesweeper done with python, to play in the terminal


In this game, you'll choose the dimensions of the board and the number of mines you want.

A board will display in the terminal, you will move on the board using the keys (8,4,2,6), uncover a box using "m" and put flags to mark bombs with p!


It's a good idea to start practicing with python code!

Enjoy it!
